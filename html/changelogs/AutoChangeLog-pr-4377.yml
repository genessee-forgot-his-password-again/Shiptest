changes:
  - {balance: ammo costs have been modified Slightly. Most of them are significantly
      cheaper.}
  - {balance: 'Rifle ammo crates with two boxes now only have one box, so the cost
      to refill one is manageable.'}
  - {balance: Specialist ammo costs cut from 100% premium to 25% premium. Now you
      might actually use them for something that isn't a bit!}
