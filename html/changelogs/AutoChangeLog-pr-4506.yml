  - {bugfix: fixed extinguishers not being able to put out turf fires sometimes}
  - {refactor: refactored extinguishers and extinguishing fires to be more sane and
      use less duplicate code}
  - {code_imp: turf fires give off fewer particles to reduce client-side lag when
      a lot of fires are on screen}
  - {code_imp: firefighting foam prevents hotspots and turf fires from being created
      instead of having to repeatedly clear them every process tick}
