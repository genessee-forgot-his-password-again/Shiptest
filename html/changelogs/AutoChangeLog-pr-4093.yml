changes:
  - {balance: Frontier armour vests are bulletproof again.}
  - {balance: 'Simple mobs drop a version of the vest that has normal armour vest
      values, player pirates and the black market version are unaffected. Frontie
      mobs inherit this armour.'}
  - {balance: The Rusted Red hardsuit has increased armour. Ramzi mobs are tougher
      as a result.}
  - {bugfix: Revert some of the health changes from Dynamic Mobs}
delete-after: true
